     * 3396. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Elements in Array Distinct
     * 
     * You are given an integer array nums. You need to ensure that the elements in the array are distinct. To achieve this, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

    Remove 3 elements from the beginning of the array. If the array has fewer than 3 elements, remove all remaining elements.
    Note that an empty array is considered to have distinct elements. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the elements in the array distinct.

     3402. Minimum Operations to Make Columns Strictly Increasing
        Solved
        Easy
        Companies
        Hint
        You are given a m x n matrix grid consisting of non-negative integers.

        In one operation, you can increment the value of any grid[i][j] by 1.

        Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all columns of grid strictly increasing.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,3],[3,4],[0,1]]

        Output: 15

        Explanation:

        To make the 0th column strictly increasing, we can apply 3 operations on grid[1][0], 2 operations on grid[2][0], and 6 operations on grid[3][0].
        To make the 1st column strictly increasing, we can apply 4 operations on grid[3][1].

                if(grid[i][j]<= grid[i-1][j]){
                    count =count+(grid[i-1][j]-grid[i][j])+1;
                    grid[i][j]=grid[i-1][j]+1;
